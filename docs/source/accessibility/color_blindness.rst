Ways to Support Color Blindness
###############################

*   Don't just communicate with color

    *   Provide symbols / textures on top of color information.
    *   Customize characters. Give them specific features like costumes or items to help tell them apart.

*   Provide color selection controls

    *   Have a color preset system: developers tag a game object as an enemy and there is a preset color for enemies
    *   Give the player a color picker that allows them to assign colors to important game elements

*   Use Color Blindness simulator tools while you develop your game

*   Make sure your accessibility options are accessible (players know they exist)
*   Test your game with color blind players and ask for community feedback.
