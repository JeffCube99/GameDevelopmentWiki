Marketing Strategies
####################

Focus on Game Highlights
************************

*   Communicate to your audience what makes your game special.
*   As a developer you know what makes your game special so identify those moments / memorable sequences and capture them in your marekting story.
*   You need to know which aspects of your game are worth emphasizing and which bits are not. For example: If you
    have a unique art style, don't focus on your double jump mechanics.
*   Stay flexible and react quickly to what's gaining traction or changing in the market.

Play Into the Game's Theme
**************************

Example: Terra Nil

*   Game about a city builder that turns a polluted wasteland into a natural paradise.
*   Marketing strategy involved donating 8% of its profits to the Endangered Wildlife trust.
*   Partnered with 50 streamers to plant more than 50,000 trees on Earth Day.

Play Into the Game's Aesthetic
******************************

Example: Cult of the Lamb

*   Distinct art style, adorable characters, and dark themes appealed to many types of gamers.
*   The unique feel and appearance made the branding easily identifiable.

Example: Cuphead

*   Unique hand drawn art with 1930's classic style animation stood out from all other games
*   The game focused on the boss fights with personality for every boss.
*   "Dark souls levels of difficulty"

Offer Players the Product and Merchandise
*****************************************

Example: Strangely Fun

*   Merchandising of T shirts with game logo and smoking themed products helped to increase game's visibility.
*   Difficult game to demo at in person events, so developer offered a simple demo for Steam Next Fest to give
    players room to explore with no time restrictions.

Tell A Story
************

*   If you are a likable human being with a story to tell, people will want to support you, even if your product isn't
    something they would usually buy.
*   People buy people first and their products second.
*   Forging human connections will curate an audience that is invested in your success.
*   Potentially play into the indie developer journey:

    *   Maybe you struggled to break into the gaming industry and decided to go it alone.
    *   Maybe you are making a spiritual successor to a game you loved as a child that other developers
        have neglected for years.

Prepare a Press Kit
*******************

*   Reviewers and Influencers can get your game in front of as many people as possible. This is important as you near
    your release date.
*   Before you reach out have a press kit prepared. This includes:

    *   Description of your game and its story
    *   Release details
    *   Screenshots and key art for use in articles, thumbnails, etc.
    *   Clear outline of information you don't want the reviewer to share with the audience.
    *   Contact details for follow up interviews or support.

*   Journalists and streamers are busy so do as much of the heavy lifting for them as possible.

Market Research
###############

*   In AAA studios, you would need to understand who your audience is, where they are, and how to reach them.
    But, as an indie developer, you don't really need to know that many details.
*   Study not your AAA games but your fellow indie developers.
*   For example: How indie developers interact with others on social media can help you understand what works
    and what elements you should include in your own marketing campaigns.

Building a Community
####################

Establish Trust
***************

Goal:

*   Show players you will take the game to completion. This is especially important for launching a kickstarter
    campaign or going early access.

Methods:

*   Create an attractive website (good websites cost $$$ however).
*   Maintain a social feed or discord server
*   Stay active and provide frequent updates. If you go silent people may start to drop off. Regular updates + a weekly
    blog post goes a long way to sustain long term interest and build a dedicated community.

Remain Visible
**************

*   Post about your game from concept to completion.
*   Post at a steady cadence:  updates, GIFs, events you attend
*   Create video content in regular intervals. Videos get big boost in visibility on Twitter.
*   Reply to everything on twitter. Get involved in conversations and add value to them. The Twitter
    algorithm pushes replies to the timeline more which gets more eyes on you.

Provide Additional Content
**************************

*   Updates, Patches, and DLC can put the spotlight back onto your game post launch.
*   Patches demonstrate a willingness to maintain your game post release and fosters trust amongst your players.
*   New content can be shared like videos, gifs, screenshots.
*   New information can circulate on blogs, steam news, etc.
*   Attract new players with discounts.
*   When communicating with news outlets, give them a game code ahead of time.

Social Media Tips
#################

Twitter
*******

*   Video posts get huge boosts.
*   Replies are pushed to the timeline more than retweets.
*   Links to other websites are penalized so never include them in your original post. If you need to include a link,
    replay to your original post with the link because by having it in the replies it doesn't impact your reach too much.

Steam
*****

*   Use `Steam Broadcasts <https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/548F-BC55-89EB-1BC8>`_ to maximize views on your page.
*   See what steam demo events your are eligible to submit for and what makes sense for your game. This combined with
    steam broadcasting can generate 500-4000 wishlists per digital events. Get into 3-4 events a year if possible.
