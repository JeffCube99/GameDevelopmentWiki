Player Retention
****************

*   Some players have short attention spans, so you should get the user into the action as quick as possible.

    *   The player should be playing the game in 3 clicks or less (including clicking on the app)
    *   Do not present the player with a menu at the start of the game. That drives a percent of users away.
        If your game does have a menu, first have the player experienced an appropriate portion of the game
        then you can send them to the menu or you can set a "has played" so that the next time the player opens the app they
        are sent to the menu.

*   Get the user to where the action is, they can get bored quickly

    *   Opening the app -> you are now playing the game
    *   Try to avoid using language to convey instructions. People aren't playing to read a manual.
        Use symbols or objects like giant red buttons to spur the player into action. This also saves on localization costs.

*   Get the player to an adrenaline point. If the game is not catchy they can easily throw it away

    *   An adrenaline point is the part of the game that makes the player want to continue playing the game. These include
        the player causing an explosion, the world flips on itself, a new powerful ability is utilized, or a great obstacle is overcome.

*   Once the user is hooked then show them ads. When they are invested in the game they will be less likely to drop
    the app when faced with ads.
