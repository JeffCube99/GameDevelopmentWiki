Design Process
==============

..  note::

    Here is a template you can use to help outline

#.  Identify a problem or define an idea

    *   "I want to make it easier for my architect client to visualize their design in 3D, which is not well-addressed
        by the solutions theyâ€™re currently trying."
    *   "We want to create a multiplayer tactical RPG."

#.  Do market research

    *   Identify the constraints facing similar products
    *   Understand what makes your vvalue proposition unique from other products.

#.  Create user personas and define use cases.

    *   An example persona has a background, motivations, goals, frustrations, and favorite games.
    *   Design your game with your target personas in mind

#.  Refine and clarify your goals
#.  Preliminary designs

    *   Creating example designs and evaluating them against the team and your personas
    *   Refine the design or move in a new direction, and then repeat the example design process again

#.  Create Prototype(s)

    *   Evaluate prototypes against target personas and game design requirements
    *   Get user feedback from internal or external sources. (See :ref:`User Testing and Feedback`).

#   Iterative design and development

    *   After prototype is signed off and the production statge is underway the iterative cycle begins
    *   Design, build, test, evaluate, refine the design.
