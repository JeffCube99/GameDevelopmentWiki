Pre-production
==============

Goals
-----

*   Establish how the game is going to look and feel. Establish the story, the gameplay, the art direction,
    the intended target audience, and accessibility.
*   Get all team members on the same page about the look and feel of the game.
*   Determine the product timeline. Assign owners to tasks that must be completed.
*   For more technical goals see :ref:`Pre Production Technical Pipeline`


What Can Go Wrong
-----------------

*   Issues can arise if a vision for the look and feel of the game is not established across all team members.
    In the middle of production you see the output of one of your team members that looks off because they had a
    different vision for the game. Fixing those kinds of issues wastes a lot of time.


Resources
---------

Design Documents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Helps you organize your ideas about your project. You should put details about the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
Be careful not to propose too many features to keep your timeline realistic. This document will serve as the single
source of truth that outlines specific requirements for the experience you want to create. This will also assist
producers and project managers to track design and development progress.

*   `Project Design Document Template #1 <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FR-GYr2hL67d6MleWTTP-mXfCHVZTM1Mko77MFodxFg/edit>`_
*   `Project Design Document Template #2 <https://docs.google.com/document/d/10lPZ95ViLsOLUKEqLehxSorp7qNQQs-ulBgQq7R5Uws/edit>`_


Project Charters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Created after design document has been approved and the project is greenlit. The Project charter is used for
outlining project objectives, how the objectives will be carried out, and who the stakeholders for each objective are.
Useful in the pre production and production phases.

*   `Project Charter Template #1 <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h6R70TV3l4yV-l4o_BmBbiZiR3n6HolyD6r1AgP7mIY/edit>`_


Production
==========

Goals
-----

*   Creating the game by the deadline set during Pre-production.
*   Taking elements from Pre-production and making them products.
    *   Concepts transformed into models.
    *   Storyboards transformed into animations.
    *   Prototypes transformed into functional applications.
    *   Feature lists transformed into playable experiences
*   For more technical goals see :ref:`Production Technical Pipeline`


Roles
-----

..  image:: /_images/roles.png

*   **Producer**: Overseas development of the entire project. Makes sure teams are hitting critical deadlines.
    Prevents feature creep (see below).


What Can Go Wrong
-----------------

*   During production, feature creep can occur. This is the process of adding new features to the product rather than
    sticking to the ones during pre production. This can result in delays to production.
    The **Producer** needs to watch out to prevent this from happening.


Resources
---------

Project Plan
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Created in pre-production and used throughout the production phase.
It is used to outline specific tasks and deliverable dates.

*   `Project Plan Template #1 <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EJNeBTG3XC7kSyercGH0pSyjgkjBD3w31pmqxz9Nqes/edit?usp=sharing>`_


Post-production
===============

Goals
-----

*   Evalueate the product and make proper edits and fixes prior to release.
*   Conduct Alpha and Beta testing to uncover things that need to be fixed.

    *   **Alpha Testing**: Used for identifying issues and areas of improvement.
    *   **Beta Testing**: Similar to alpha except it is for getting feedback from end users.


What Can Go Wrong
-----------------

*   You could potentially mismanage bug / feature requests. For example. What if there was a bug that
    made the experience 5% worse but a feature that made the experience 50% better. Which one should you
    address given a limited time frame.


Operations
==========

Goals
-----

*   **Support the game**: dealing with incoming questions, requests, and problems from users and partners
*   **Monetize the game**: in-app purchases and advertising within the game or app to bring in revenue
*   **Analyze user information**: tracking and analyzing user data to inform any needed changes to the gameâ€™s
    functionality, marketing, or business strategy
*   **Maintain game servers**: ensuring that any servers supporting the game are operating properly
*   **Maintain game website**: managing and updating the website that promotes or sells the game
*   **Market and sell the game**: continued marketing, public relations, partnerships, and other strategies to promote
    sales of the game
*   Until the product is discontinued, deprecated, or "sunsettled", the operations phase should continue.


Project Retrospectives
======================

Goals
-----

*   Work with your team to understand areas during the production cycle that went well, areas that did not go well,
    and ways to improve for future projects.
