Quality Assurance Testing
=========================

Overview
========

Purpose: Identifying issues and areas of improvement.

Test Scripts
============

*   A series of steps a tester should follow. They then record their observations.
*   Scripts are created before formal testing starts.
*   Used to evaluate the product against specific product requirements.
*   Should test team's assumptions about the user experience of the product

Bug Report Tracking
===================

*   Use external tools like Jira and Github Issues to track bug reports.
*   Typical bug reports include:

    *   Title / brief summary: A descriptive title for the bug.
    *   Identified frequency: How often does this bug occur (every time, most times, randomly, rarely)?
    *   Reproduction steps: Precise steps on how to reproduce the bug. This should be detailed enough that a developer
        can recreate the bug themselves without any additional information.
    *   Detailed description:  A more detailed summary of the bug and its impact on user experience.
    *   Any other observations: These could include thoughts on what may be causing the bug and other relevant details
        (for example, “error occurs inconsistently, but more frequently at night than during the day”).
